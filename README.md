This is my CSGO cheat client. I came across some cheaters in a game, and decided to try my hand at making my own cheat software.

Besides csgo.hpp, dx.cpp and D3DFont.cpp, all source code in this solution was written by me. This software is compiled as a DLL, and is executed through DLL injection. This allows my code to directly access game memory, rather than have to use ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory.
