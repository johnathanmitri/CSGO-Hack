This is my CSGO cheat client. I didn't make this with malicious intent, and never distributed it.

Thereâ€™s hundreds of cheat softwares available on the internet, that have far more features, and are available for anybody to download, but I wanted to make my own.

Besides csgo.hpp, dx.cpp and D3DFont.cpp, all source code in this solution was written entirely by me. This software is compiled as a DLL, and is executed through DLL injection. This allows my code to access game memory directly, rather than using ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory.
